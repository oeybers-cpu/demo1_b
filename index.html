        <h2>James Paul Gee (2010): A Situated Sociocultural Approach to Literacy and Technology</h2>

        <p>James Paul Gee's (2010) seminal work, "A Situated Sociocultural Approach to Literacy and Technology," offers a transformative framework for understanding literacy in the digital age. Gee synthesizes insights from the New Literacy Studies (NLS), Situated Cognition Studies, and New Media Literacy Studies to argue that literacy is not merely a cognitive skill but a socially and culturally situated practice. According to Gee, literacy must be understood as participation in "Discourses" (with a capital D), which are socially accepted ways of using language, thinking, believing, valuing, and acting in particular contexts. This perspective moves beyond viewing literacy as simple decoding and comprehension, positioning it instead as a form of social identity and cultural membership.</p>

        <p>Gee emphasizes that different social and cultural groups—such as gamers, scientists, legal professionals, or religious communities—develop distinct "literacies" tied to their specific practices. For instance, reading a video game FAQ or a Yu-Gi-Oh card requires not just linguistic competence but also understanding the specialized knowledge, values, and interactional norms of the gaming community. This pluralistic view of literacy as "multiple literacies" challenges traditional educational models that often privilege only academic or standardized forms of language use, while marginalizing the rich literacy practices found in popular culture and informal learning environments.</p>

        <p>A central contribution of Gee's work is the concept of "situated meaning," which posits that true understanding emerges not from abstract knowledge but from active engagement in meaningful activities. He illustrates this through the example of video games, where players develop deep comprehension of complex rules and systems not by reading manuals in isolation, but by playing the game and experiencing how language connects to action. This "game-like learning" fosters what Gee calls "lucidly functional language"—specialist language that is tightly coupled with concrete actions and experiences. Such learning environments allow even young children to master sophisticated linguistic and cognitive demands, suggesting powerful implications for education.</p>

        <p>Gee further introduces the idea of "Pro-Ams" (professional amateurs)—individuals, especially youth, who use digital tools and online communities to develop expert-level knowledge in areas of personal passion, such as game design, fan fiction, or digital storytelling. These informal learning ecosystems demonstrate how digital technologies are reshaping participation, production, and expertise in society. Gee argues that schools must learn from these models by embedding literacy instruction in authentic, activity-based contexts that mirror the situated, collaborative, and identity-forming practices of digital culture.</p>
